Causal Effect Analysis
================================================================================

Error Propagation Rates by Condition:

FAITHFUL Models:
  Baseline     → 96.3% propagated error (157/163 valid, 6 unclear, 0 errors)
  Ablation     →  5.5% propagated error (9/163 valid, 6 unclear, 0 errors)
  Replacement  → 16.4% propagated error (27/165 valid, 4 unclear, 0 errors)

SELF-CORRECTED Models:
  Baseline     →  4.0% propagated error (4/99 valid, 10 unclear, 0 errors)
  Ablation     →  1.0% propagated error (1/105 valid, 4 unclear, 0 errors)
  Replacement  →  6.1% propagated error (6/99 valid, 10 unclear, 0 errors)

================================================================================
Causal Effects (Change from Baseline)
================================================================================

FAITHFUL:
  Ablation Effect:    -90.8% (removing error token)
  Replacement Effect: -80.0% (replacing with truth)
  Statistical Test:   χ² = 265.23, p = 0.0000

SELF-CORRECTED:
  Ablation Effect:     -3.1% (removing error token)
  Replacement Effect:  +2.0% (replacing with truth)
  Statistical Test:   χ² = 0.95, p = 0.3308

================================================================================
Interpretation
================================================================================

Key Findings:

✓ FAITHFUL models are CAUSALLY DEPENDENT on error token:
  → Removing error reduces propagation by 90.8%
  → This SUPPORTS the embedding analysis (they DO read the error)
  → CONTRADICTS attention analysis (low attention but high causal effect)
  → Resolution: Attention weights don't capture full causal influence
  → The error token has mechanistic importance despite low attention scores

✓ SELF-CORRECTED models IGNORE the error token:
  → Ablation has minimal effect (-3.1%)
  → Confirms they were not using the error for reasoning
  → They compute independently of the injected mistake
