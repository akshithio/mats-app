   So, the other son is 8 years old.

2. **Determine the total number of candles needed:**
   - The first son needs 12 candles.
   - The second son needs 8 candles.
   \[
   12 + 8 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, James needs a total of 20 candles.

3. **Calculate the number of packs of candles required:**
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 8
   \]
   So, James needs 8 packs of candles.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the candles:**
   - Each pack costs $3.
   \[
   8'
  Continuation [309:353]: ' \times 3 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost for the candles is $24.

Thus, the amount James sp...'
