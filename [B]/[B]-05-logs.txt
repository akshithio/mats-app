  Using CoT prefix (length 318 of 859):
    To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the ages of James's sons:**
   - One son is 12 years old.
   - The other son is 4 years younger than 12.

  CORRUPTED_BASELINE:
    Generated (first 150 chars):  - The first son needs 12 candles.
   - The second son needs 8 candles.
   \[
   12 + 8 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, James needs a total of 20 candles.
