For the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\), the function is undefined where the denominator is zero because division by zero is not allowed.\n\nSet the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\pm 2\n\\]\n\nSo, the function is undefined at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Therefore, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is all real numbers except \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). In interval notation, the domain is:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range\nThe range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values) of the function. To find the range, we need to analyze the behavior of the function.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the function in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny(x^2 - 4) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nyx^2 - 4y = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nyx^2 = 1 + 4y\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{1 + 4y}{y}\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{1}{y} + 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x^2 \\) is always non-negative (i.e., \\( x^2 \\geq 0 \\)), the expression \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 \\) must also be non-negative:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} + 4 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} \\geq -4\n\\]\n\nThis inequality holds for all \\( y \\) except \\( y = 0 \\) (since division by zero is undefined). We need to consider the sign of \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\):\n- If \\( y > 0 \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{y} > 0 \\), so \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 > 4 \\), which is always positive.\n- If \\( y < 0 \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{y} < 0 \\), so \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 < 4 \\). For \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 \\) to be non-negative, \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\) must be greater than or equal to \\(-4\\), which means \\( y \\leq -\\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore, the range of \\( f(x) \\) is all real numbers except \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4} \\). In interval notation, the range is:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}] \\cup (0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe domain of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\nThe range of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}] \\cup (0, \\infty)}\n\\]",

For the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\), the function is undefined where the denominator is zero because division by zero is not allowed.\n\nSet the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\pm 2\n\\]\n\nSo, the function is undefined at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Therefore, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is all real numbers except \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). In interval notation, the domain is:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range\nThe range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values) of the function. To find the range, we need to analyze the behavior of the function.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the function in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny(x^2 - 4) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nyx^2 - 4y = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nyx^2 = 1 + 4y\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{1 + 4y}{y}\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{1}{y} + 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x^2 \\) is always non-negative (i.e., \\( x^2 \\geq 0 \\)), the expression \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 \\) must also be non-negative:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} + 4 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} \\geq -4\n\\]\n\nThis inequality holds for all \\( y \\) except \\( y = 0 \\) (since division by zero is undefined). We need to consider the sign of \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\):\n- If \\( y > 0 \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{y} > 0 \\), so \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 > 4 \\), which is always positive.\n- If \\( y < 0 \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{y} < 0 \\), so \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 < 4 \\). For \\( \\frac{1}{y} + 4 \\) to be non-negative, \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\) must be greater than or equal to \\(-4\\), which means \\( y \\leq -\\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore, the range of \\( f(x) \\) is all real numbers except \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4} \\). In interval notation, the range is:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}] \\cup (0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe domain of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\nThe range of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}] \\cup (0, \\infty)}\n\\]",

For the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\), the function is undefined where the denominator is zero because division by zero is not allowed.\n\nSet the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\nThis can be factored as:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\nSo, the solutions are:\n\\[\nx = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -2\n\\]\nTherefore, the function is undefined at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). The domain of the function is all real numbers except \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). In interval notation, the domain is:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range\nThe range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values) of the function. To find the range, we need to analyze the behavior of the function.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the function in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4}\n\\]\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\ny(x^2 - 4) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nyx^2 - 4y = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nyx^2 = 1 + 4y\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{1 + 4y}{y}\n\\]\nFor \\( x^2 \\) to be a real number, the right-hand side must be non-negative:\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + 4y}{y} \\geq 0\n\\]\nThis inequality holds when \\( y \\) is in the intervals \\( (-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}] \\cup (0, \\infty) \\). The value \\( y = 0 \\) is not included because it would make the denominator zero in the original function.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function is:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}] \\cup (0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \\) is \\(\\boxed{(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)}\\) and the range is \\(\\boxed{(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}] \\cup (0, \\infty)}\\).",
